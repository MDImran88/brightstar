          <div class="col-6">
            <p>These days sending children, who have just crossed the 2+ yr barrier, to a play school is looked upon as a normal and accepted part of the Delhi lifestyle. The concept had started more than a decade-and-a-half ago and at that time the very idea of sending a 2 to 3 year old to a ‘school’ seemed shocking to most citizens of Delhi. It was a nearby ‘aunty’ or a couple of housewives who had put up some basic kind of infrastructure that was called a day-care facility and thus pioneered the introduction of play schools in Delhi. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6">
            <p>Such small-scale and domestic play-schools were largely unprofessional in nature and were operated with the most humble of budgets and were looked upon as a method of keeping the children busy for a few hours. Initially, sending one’s child to these ‘play schools’ was looked upon as a sign of being rich or as a mark of being socially progressive. However, with the passage of time and the changing financial equations of Delhi households, the ideology associated with sending children to a play school has also changed.
